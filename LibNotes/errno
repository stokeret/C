The errno.h header file of the C Standard Library defines the integer variable errno, which is set by system calls and 
some library functions in the event of an error to indicate what went wrong. This macro expands to a modifiable 
lvalue of type int, therefore it can be both read and modified by a program.

The errno is set to zero at program startup. Certain functions of the standard C library modify its value to other 
than zero to signal some types of error. You can also modify its value or reset to zero at your convenience.

The errno.h header file also defines a list of macros indicating different error codes, which will expand to 
integer constant expressions with type int.

# Library Macros

Following are the macros defined in the header errno.h âˆ’
Sr.No. 	Macro & Description
1 	extern int errno
        This is the macro set by system calls and some library functions in the event of an error to indicate what went 
        wrong.

2 	EDOM Domain Error
        This macro represents a domain error, which occurs if an input argument is outside the domain, over which the 
        mathematical function is defined and errno is set to EDOM.

3 	ERANGE Range Error
        This macro represents a range error, which occurs if an input argument is outside the range, over which 
        the mathematical function is defined and errno is set to ERANGE.
