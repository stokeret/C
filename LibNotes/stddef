The stddef.h header defines various variable types and macros. Many of these definitions also appear in other headers.
Library Variables

Following are the variable types defined in the header stddef.h −
Sr.No. 	Variable & Description
1 	

ptrdiff_t

This is the signed integral type and is the result of subtracting two pointers.
2 	

size_t

This is the unsigned integral type and is the result of the sizeof keyword.
3 	

wchar_t

This is an integral type of the size of a wide character constant.
Library Macros

Following are the macros defined in the header stddef.h −
Sr.No. 	Macro & Description
1 	NULL

This macro is the value of a null pointer constant.
2 	offsetof(type, member-designator)

This results in a constant integer of type size_t which is the offset in bytes of a structure member from the beginning of the structure. The member is given by member-designator, and the name of the structure is given in type.
